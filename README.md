## Getting Started

1. Make sure git is installed on your machine. In case git has not yet been installed, 
obtain it from: https://git-scm.com/downloads
2. Open a terminal session and navigate to the directory where you would like to store the code by using 'cd', for example navigate to
your desktop:
![TerminalDir](terminal_dir_example.png)
3. Open the bitbucket repository and copy the link to clone:
![Bitbucket](git_clone.png)
4. Paste the command (git clone ... ) into your terminal. 

The code is now stored in your desired location and everything is ready to go!


### Prerequisites

* Python 3.8 needs to be installed on your machine in order to be able to execute the code.

* All additional libraries used will be installed automatically when executing the program.

## Code Execution

The code can be navigated via simple selection options.

## Versioning

We use bitbucket to version the code. Prior commits can be obtained from 
https://bitbucket.org/aboomer07/examtse2020-21/commits/.
